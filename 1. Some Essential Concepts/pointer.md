Pointer is an address variable that is meant for storing address of data, not the data itself.

They access the data indirectly.
```
<datatype> *pointer_name
```

For printing value pointed by pointer
```
*pointer_name
```

Why pointers...???

* Accessing heap memory as program doesn't directly access heap memory, to access we need pointers.
* Helps in accessing resources that are outside the program. eg. accessing data on hard disk.
* Parameter passing

Pointer is stored inside *Stack* in the main memory.
