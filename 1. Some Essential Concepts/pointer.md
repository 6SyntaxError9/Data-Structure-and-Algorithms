Pointer is an address variable that is meant for storing address of data, not the data itself.

They access the data indirectly.

Why pointers...???

* Accessing heap memory as program doesn't directly access heap memory, to access we need pointers.
* Helps in accessing resources that are outside the program. eg. accessing data on hard disk.
