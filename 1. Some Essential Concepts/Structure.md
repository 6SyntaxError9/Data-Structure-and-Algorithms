# Structures

Strucutres are defined as collectionn of data members under one name; those data members may be of same or different data types.

Strucutre is used for defining user defined data types by using primitive data types as per our requirements.

```
struct strucutre_name
{
  <datatype> variable;
  <datatype> variable;
  .
  .
  .
  <datatype> variable;
}
```

For defining a variable of structure type we need to follow following insede main
```
struct structure_name variable_name;
```
